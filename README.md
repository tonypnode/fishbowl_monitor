# FishBowl Monitor
Just a fun project for me to learn some Python, Django and work with some
sensors and the raspberry pi 3. I will attempt to use [Test Driven Development
(TDD) to accomplish this project](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com).

### What do I want it to do right now?
I'm hoping, it will do the following:
 *  Provide a web interface
 *  Display fishbowl water temperature

### Future features I want to add
 * Show data trends over time (grpahs n stuff)
 * Take a pic of the fishy every once in a while
 * a button to push when someone feeds the fish
 * Track who feeds the fish (picture?)
 * Track fishbowl ph balance

Hardware (still a work in progress):
1. Betta Fish and Fishbowl :)
2. RaspberryPi v3
3. DS18B20 Waterproof Thermal Temp. Sensor
4. Bread board
5. 4K ohm resister


## Resources
* This is the site I am going to use to get the temp sensor working
 and collecting data https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-temperature-sensor/


## Database Schtuff

temperature model
* Date time
* temperature

and that should be it for now

Eventually I'm thinking about adding..:
feeding model
* date time
* image location? if a picture is being taken
